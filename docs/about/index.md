Hi! Thanks for visiting my blog. Many of you may be wondering "who is this Jason guy and what does he know about paginated reporting?" That is an excellent question and kudos to you for asking it.

I've been working on the Reporting Services team since the SoftArtisans acquisition in November of 2005. My Microsoft career started off working on the client tools like Report Builder 2.0 and BI Development Studio with features like the Rich Text improvement and the RDL Downgrade logic when publishing to older versions in BI Development Studio.

I also own [Mechavian SC LLC](https://www.mechavian.com) which I've used for random business ventures and consulting. Stay tuned this summer for the release of our hot sauce to select regions... ðŸ˜ƒ

Aside from software development, I have a passion for aviation and aviation related projects. I am currently building a [Van's RV-12iS](https://www.vansaircraft.com/rv-12is/) in my garage and hoping to have it ready for its first flight around December 2020. I've had my pilots license since 2013 and enjoy all sorts of aviation related activities from simple $100 hamburger flights to more daring [wing walking](http://masonwingwalking.com/).

If you have any topics you'd like to see covered in this blog, please feel free to let me know in the comments.

Happy Reporting!  
\- Jason
